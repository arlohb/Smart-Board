This is a smart board similar to DAK board, but free and open source.

The temperature is got from serial input in the format temperature, humidity


'config.json' contains configurable things.
To configure the arrangement of the items, change the number values within 'modules',
then underneath define the modules to be used with the values 0-9.
The values in modules have to start from 0 and not miss out values, but don't have to go up to 9

These are the available modules:
	"Clock",
	"SerialTemperature",
	"Calendar",
	"MinuteCast"

Dependencies:
	npm install ical.js
	npm install moment

To run this, you will need to run a server (I use apache), and place this project into the web folder.
Then just connect to the server and it should just work.

WARNING: do not run this on a public server, as it requires no authentication so you're calendar any other data will be accessible to anyone!
