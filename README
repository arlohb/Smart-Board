This is a smart board similar to DAK board, but free and open source.

To use the calender, enter the ics url into 'config.txt'

To run this, you will need to run a server (I use apache), and place this project into the web folder.
Then just connect to the server and it should just work.

WARNING: do not run this on a public server, as it requires no authentication so you're calender any other data will be accessible to anyone!
