This is a smart board similar to DAK board, but free and open source.

To use the calender, enter the ics url into 'icsUrl.txt'
To use minutecast, go to the accuweather website for your location, select minutecast, and copy this address to the 'minutecastUrl.txt'

Dependencies:
	npm install ical.js
	npm install moment

To run this, you will need to run a server (I use apache), and place this project into the web folder.
Then just connect to the server and it should just work.

WARNING: do not run this on a public server, as it requires no authentication so you're calender any other data will be accessible to anyone!
